# Basic converter example

The example shows the ability of the CSV converter to work with nested JSON arrays and objects. The code inside `NestedConverter` converts the input JSON file (`input.json`) to CSV; `output.csv` shows the result of such action.

> Note: The code is simplified (no package etc.) and assumes the CWD to be set to the current directory.
