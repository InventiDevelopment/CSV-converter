# Basic converter example

The example shows a basic usage of the CSV converter. The code inside `BasicConverter` converts the input JSON file (`input.json`) to CSV; `output.csv` shows the result of such action.

> Note: The code is simplified (no package etc.) and assumes the CWD to be set to the current directory.
