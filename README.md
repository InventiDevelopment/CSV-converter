# CSV conventer
## Steps

1. Look and try to understand the implementation (algorithm/implementation is complicated to understand)
2. Create more example JSON files (different structures, data)
3. Write jUnit tests for created JSON files, check if the result is correct)
4. Try to refactor bigger and complicated methods (make the code more beautiful)
5. Make the library from the code (Maven library, programmer can use the library in his maven project.)
6. Write documentation (README.md)
